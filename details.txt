Purpose for Personal Blog (Updated):
The purpose of your personal blog is to document and showcase your comprehensive learning journey in software development, covering everything from LeetCode, DSA training, and college exam preparation to your growing expertise in various technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React. You aim to share your progress in both academic and professional pursuits, giving insights into how you balance coding, exam prep, and other extracurricular activities like theatre and art.
